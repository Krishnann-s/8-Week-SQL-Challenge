# 8-Week-SQL-Challenge

This repository contains the solutions for the case studies in [#8WeekSQLChallenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/).  

The 8 Week SQL Challenge is started by [Danny Ma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/datawithdanny/) through [Data With Danny](https://www.linkedin.com/company/datawithdanny/) virtual data apprenticeship program, which consists of 8 different SQL challenges. 

It showcases my ability to tackle various SQL challenges and demonstrates my proficiency in SQL query writing and problem-solving skills.
